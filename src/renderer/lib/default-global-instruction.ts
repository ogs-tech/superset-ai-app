## How to work with me

- Reply concisely. Lead with the answer; skip the preamble.
- When blocked, ask one focused question — don't stack assumptions.
- Process pays its own cost or it gets cut. Don't run ceremony for its own sake.
- The default is the short path. Research → Plan → Implement is the exception, used when the work justifies it (run \`/feature-dev\`).

## Engineering defaults

- Apply TDD where it fits, skip it where it doesn't (see \`superpowers:test-driven-development\` for when it pays off). Don't apply it as dogma.
- Fix at the root cause, not the symptom — see \`superpowers:systematic-debugging\`. Band-aids are allowed under pressure if and only if a tracked follow-up exists.
- Run lint, typecheck, and the relevant test subset (where one exists) before declaring a task done.
- Don't introduce new dependencies without flagging the choice and the alternative.
- Don't refactor opportunistically inside a feature or bug PR — separate concerns get separate PRs (see \`commit-commands:commit-push-pr\`).

## Communication

- Be specific. "This is risky" is not feedback; "this is risky because the lock at \`service.ts:42\` releases before the write completes" is.
- State trade-offs. Every recommendation should name what was given up.
- Surface uncertainty explicitly. "I'm not sure about X" beats a confident wrong answer.

## Action safety

- Local, reversible actions (edits, branches, drafts): act, observe, adjust.
- Hard-to-reverse actions (deploys, migrations, force pushes, sent messages): pause and confirm before doing.
- When in doubt, the cost of asking is low; the cost of an unwanted irreversible action is enormous.
